# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge


## Why I decided to join?
I need to make this public statement in order to push myself and develop a habit to code with ease, without going through 'conversation' in my head whether or not if this is a good time to code. Also by nature I am introverted person so sharing my progress will improve my social skills and be more engaged in Networking.

## What I am going to work on?
#### Create blogging feature in my personal website
That means: UI for input new post - Create Back end server and authentification - Database for all posts (PostreSQL)

#### Kick off **PilotYourself** project that I've been planning to create for the last couple of years.
This projects intended to help someone who is lacking consistensy to stay on track and make progress in the long run (person like me). To define the goal and build consistency progressing toward it.
