# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created fully functional Vanila JS carousel

**Thoughts:** It is allways good to create something with pure JS without framework or any libraries

### Day 1: August 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advance concepts of **_this_** in javascript and how to use it in conjunction with call, apply and bind methods.

**Thoughts:** Everything in JS is lexically scoped unless in case of **_this_**.
Methods are properties of objects. When method contains function declaration and when we call it no longer 'belongs' to an object where it lexically scoped, basically **_window_** object calls this function.

**_Bind_** gotcha: object you pass inside first argument in bind will sorta 'own' this method

### Day 2: September 1st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Breathing app 4-7-8 technique

**Thoughts:** implemented via vanila JS, with traversy media based tutorial, expanded with custom intervals, and with 4-7-8 approach. Next step will be doing Start/Stop buttons. Most likely will re-do this with React

### Day 3: September 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Breathing app 4-7-8, added countdowm timer, some hickups, but progressing

**Thoughts:** Step closer to start/stop. Today added setinterval, which will update seconds countdown on the screen
