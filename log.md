# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created fully functional Vanila JS carousel

**Thoughts:** It is allways good to create something with pure JS without framework or any libraries

### Day 1: August 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advance concepts of ***this*** in javascript and how to use it in conjunction with call, apply and bind methods.

**Thoughts:** Everything in JS is lexically scoped unless in case of ***this***.
Methods are properties of objects. When method contains function declaration and when we call it no longer 'belongs' to an object where it lexically scoped, basically ***window*** object calls this function.


***Bind*** gotcha: object you pass inside first argument in bind will sorta 'own' this method
