# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created contact form in contact me page (No functionality yet)

**Thoughts:** Styled components are not that bad.. I had wrong opinion about this library. Issue is, that I need to properly place the form itself with the rest of content of the page.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
